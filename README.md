> Save chords of your favorite songs in plain text and the app will detect and transpose them for you.

Sometimes the chords on the internet are just not accurate. 
However, every time I write my own chords, I always struggle to transpose them. 
Hence, this app is created.

This app is kind of simple now. 
If you do like it, I would add more features in the future.
